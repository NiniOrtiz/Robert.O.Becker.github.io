# Welcome to the Robert O. Becker Lab


## Who we are?

We are a diverse group of individuals that are interested in researching novel ideas and theoretical approaches that could help us understand pattern formation in multicellular organisms and large-scale control of 3D-form. We are specifically interested in understanding the molecular and computational mechanisms that sustain the development of complex anatomy in animals , the regeneration of tissues  as well as how these mechanisms break-down in cancer and aging. Our approach uses techniques that encompass many areas of science like bioinformatics, systems biology, computational modeling , information theory and biophysics to face these complex puzzles. At the present time we are focused in the standarization of a zebrafish model and the science communication of recent developments in bioelectricity focused developmental biology. The goal of the Robert O. Becker lab is to understand the fundamental principles and rules that guide cells to synchronyze towards large-scale patterning goals.
