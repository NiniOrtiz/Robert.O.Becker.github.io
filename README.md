## Who we are?

We are a diverse group of individuals that are interested in researching novel ideas and theoretical approaches that could help us understand pattern formation in multicellular organisms and large-scale control of 3D-form. We are specifically interested in understanding the molecular and computational mechanisms that sustain the development of complex anatomy in animals , the regeneration of tissues  as well as how these mechanisms break-down in cancer and aging. Our approach uses techniques that encompass many areas of science like bioinformatics, systems biology, computational modeling , information theory and biophysics to face these complex puzzles. At the present time we are focused in the standarization of zebrafish model and the science communication of recent developments in bioelectricity focused developmental bioloy. 



e work on novel ways to understand and control complex pattern formation. We use techniques of molecular genetics, biophysics, and computational modeling to address large-scale control of growth and form. We work in whole frogs and flatworms, and sometimes zebrafish and human tissues in culture. Our projects span regeneration, embryogenesis, cancer, and learning plasticity â€“ all examples of how cellular networks process information. In all of these efforts, our goal is not only to understand the molecular mechanisms necessary for morphogenesis, but also to uncover and exploit the cooperative signaling dynamics that enable complex bodies to build and remodel themselves toward a correct structure. Our major goal is to understand how individual cell behaviors are orchestrated towards appropriate large-scale outcomes despite unpredictable environmental perturbations. Some general themes that run through our diverse research together include:
